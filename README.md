Exercises
=========
Working in your teams from the Rapid Prototyping challenge:

-     Create a kanban board with some degree of automation
-     Create some issues on your repo indicating a missing feature or broken code
-     Assign an issue to each team member
-     Try working in a distributed way today - so everyone works on their own copy of the repo
-     Create a staging branch on the central repo
-     Work on your assigned issue on your own fork and when you are done, make a PR to the staging branch on the main repo
-     Merge the PRs into staging, resolving any conflicts that arise as a team
-     When staging is looking good, merge to your production deploy branch

Working solo:
